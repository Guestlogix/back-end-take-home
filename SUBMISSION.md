# GuestLogix Flight API 

## Introduction
This solution was built using the BFS(Breath First Search Algorithm) to:
- Fetch Connecting Flights between a given origin and destination in the query params
- Give user feedback when a given origin or destination does not exist
- Give user feedback when no route is found between a given origin and destination.

## Getting Started
To run this application locally, simply follow the following steps:
- Clone the repo
- Install dependencies by running `npm install --save`
- Run `node migration.js` to seed your local db
- Wait for about 30 seconds for the above process to complete
- Clear your terminal and run `npm start`
- The server is running live on: `localhost:3000`

## Testing the API
- Go to Postman or your browser and pass in the url: `localhost:3000/api/routes?origin=XXX&destination=YYY`
- XXX and YYY represent the 'IATA 3' code for your origin and destination respectively.
- A sample test with `http://localhost:3000/api/routes?origin=ABJ&destination=IST` will return:
